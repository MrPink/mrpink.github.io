    <div class="about-text">
        <p>Hey, I'm Will. I'm a Lead Engineer who gets genuinely excited about developer experience, cloud-native architecture, and the craft of building systems that scale gracefully.</p>
        <p>By day, I'm deep in Kubernetes clusters, Terraform configs, and CI/CD pipelines. By night, I'm probably still thinking about them—but also exploring how AI is reshaping how we write and ship code.</p>
        <p>This blog is where I share what I'm learning, the problems I'm solving, and the occasional opinion on where our industry is heading.</p>
